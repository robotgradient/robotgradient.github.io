I am a researcher in Robot Learning.
Previously, I was a Research Scientist in the Robotics group led by [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/) at META FAIR.
Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab (IAS)](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/).
I received my PhD in Computer Science with summa cum laude from TU Darmstadt under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).
Previously, I interned as a researcher in [Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab (SRL)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/).
My research have received several awards including several best paper awards and I was finalist for the George Giralt PhD award.
I was honoured to be selected as an R:SS Pioneer in 2023.

I am particularly interested in **figuring out the foundations for building generalist robots**. I think that this goal can be only achieved by figuring out novel strategies to scale the available data for robotics and finding novel algorithmic and architectural elements to enhance the generalization of our systems. In this direction, I explore the combination of fields such as **deep generative models, 3D robot learning, learning from video, and optimization.**


If you have any questions / want to collaborate, feel free to send me an email! I am always excited to learn more by talking with people. Please include "HEYJULEN" in the subject of the email so that I don't miss it.
